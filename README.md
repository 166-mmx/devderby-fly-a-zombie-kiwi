# Fly-a-zombie-kiwi

My attempt to Mozilla DevDerby for topic: February 2012 Touch Events

Original description:
**Catch brains to refill your brain-mana, go through turbo-tunnels to boost your speed, jump on pillows!**

Fly as far as you can! Using turbo-tunnels you can boost your speed, in emergency situations jump on the pillows. The zombie-kiwi is still able to jump using its brain-mana - catch brains to refill it.
